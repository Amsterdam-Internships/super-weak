What is my baseline??

- Lison et al. (2020) paper model, so English zero-shot transfer to Dutch
- Spacy default Dutch NER model

Benchmarking set:
- CoNLL-2002 

Will have to make an evaluation script and will also have to separate the texts from the CoNLL file as to make it Spacy-readable -> how? 
- spacy.gold?
